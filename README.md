# What's a Brute Force Attack?
A brute force attack uses trial-and-error to guess login info, encryption keys, or find a hidden web page. Hackers work through all possible combinations hoping to guess correctly.

These attacks are done by ‘brute force’ meaning they use excessive forceful attempts to try and ‘force’ their way into your private account(s).

This is an old attack method, but it's still effective and popular with hackers. Because depending on the length and complexity of the password, cracking it can take anywhere from a few seconds to many years.



# What do hackers gain from Brute Force Attacks?
Brute force attackers have to put in a bit of effort to make these schemes pay off. While technology does make it easier, you might still question: why would someone do this?

### Here’s how hackers benefit from brute force attacks:

##### Profiting from ads or collecting activity data
#####  Stealing personal data and valuables
#####  Spreading malware to cause disruptions
#####  Hijacking your system for malicious activity
#####  Ruining a website’s reputation
